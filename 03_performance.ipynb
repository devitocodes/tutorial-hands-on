Since Devito doesn't make assumptions about the PDEs, the presence of an optimization system such as the DSE becomes of fundamental importance. In fact, we know that its impact has been remarkable in real-life siesmic inversion operators that have been written on top of Devito (e.g., TTI operators).\n",
